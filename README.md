# DeAnno

DeAnno is a on-chain global gig task platform, where users can utilize their spare time to complete data annotation tasks and receive remuneration and token rewards. The tokens can be staking and dividends. In the future, it will serve as the first application of a SuperWallet for youth in the Third World.

## Tokenomic Design

- Token name: DAN, with a fixed total issuance.
- Worker rewards: 1.stablecoins paid by the Demander(platform takes a 20% commission) 2.for every task completed, a certain amount of DAN will be minted (platform takes a 20% commission)
- token issuance coefficient: workers receive more in the early stages.
- DAN application scenario: Staking dividends. The platform will allocate 50% of its profits to reward DAN stakers.
- As the platform's order volume increases, the market price of DAN will also increase, further attracting more workers to earn DAN, and enticing more people to trade DAN, thereby achieving a flywheel effect.
